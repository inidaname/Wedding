#Confession of a Developer.
##TLDR, I'm getting married but I'm in love someone else

>If you are my fiance and you are reading this, I'm sorry I'm cheating on you and it not what you think, seriously it not you it me.

Okay let's skip the it not what you think story.

Recently I recieved some like a very big news, my wedding was fixed for 4th of May 2018.

Paused are you Married please I need to know this few weeks to the wedding is seriously scary.

I tried to handle my scary weeks by building some of the never used apps.

I'm not to bore you on we met but during the time we spend together.

I know all developers are guilty of this so let me discribe my feelings for my fiance in that way.
When I just purchase a new Windows 10 PC, I would go online open up Edge download Mozilla, open up Mozilla and finally download Chrome. No special reason it just my way of doing things.

My fiance is Edge in my Windows 10 PC.

I don't call
I never callback
We don't have that much closure
it not like a synced relationshed
She always bugs me about any little problems
